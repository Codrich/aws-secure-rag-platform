# Architecture Overview

## Request flow (target, Phase 4)

1. Client authenticates against Cognito, receives JWT.
2. Request hits API Gateway: WAF rules, throttling, JWT authorizer.
3. FastAPI service on ECS Fargate (private subnet, no public IP) validates the request and the caller's role.
4. Retrieval: query embedded, pgvector searched with metadata filters INCLUDING document-level authorization for the caller's role.
5. Retrieved chunks + user query -> Bedrock (via VPC endpoint) with Guardrails applied on input and output.
6. Response returned with source citations; metadata (tokens, latency, model ID, guardrail events) logged redacted; request record written to DynamoDB.

## Ingestion flow (target, Phase 3)

S3 upload (synthetic docs) -> EventBridge -> SQS -> ingestion worker:
extract, chunk, embed, store in pgvector with metadata (source, roles,
timestamps). Failures -> DLQ with status tracking.

## Key decisions

### ADR-001: pgvector over OpenSearch Serverless for v1

RDS PostgreSQL + pgvector demonstrates the same RAG fundamentals
(vector similarity search, metadata filtering, private connectivity,
encryption, backups) without OpenSearch Serverless's always-on OCU cost
floor. OpenSearch Serverless becomes preferable at enterprise scale:
high ingest throughput, hybrid lexical+vector retrieval, native Bedrock
Knowledge Base integration. The service's retrieval layer is
interface-based so the store can be swapped.

### ADR-002: ECS Fargate over EKS for v1

Fargate keeps operational surface small and cost low while proving the
containerized-platform patterns. An EKS deployment variant (Helm,
ArgoCD) is a planned Phase 8 extension, reusing patterns from the
maintainer's existing aws-eks-gitops-platform project.

### ADR-003: Model ID as configuration

The Bedrock model ID is injected via environment/Parameter Store, never
hardcoded. The service targets the Converse API for cross-model
portability.
