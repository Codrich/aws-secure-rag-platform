"""Sensitive-data DETECTION gates driven by the security case file.

Every case in evaluations/security/sensitive_data_cases.json is executed -
the file was previously read by nothing.

Scope, stated plainly:

* What these tests verify: detection behavior of app.core.sensitive_data.
  Given the case input, the correct pattern fires and the detector's
  recommended disposition is correct.
* What these tests do NOT verify: request/response enforcement. The
  detector is not called from RagService, the API routes, or any other
  runtime path, so nothing here shows the platform blocking a request or
  masking an answer.
* No claim is made about blocking or masking in the live RAG path. The
  ``expected`` values describe the intended control; ``control_status``
  records that only detection exists today.

Runtime enforcement and live Bedrock Guardrails behavior are Phase 5.
